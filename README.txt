UPDATE:
The 'Main Script' is now the main script I use in my editing. It has all of the features of the other scripts built
into it, making it a much more advanced and consise script. There ARE known bugs and it is still being tested.
In addition to this, the MIDI folder has also been added. The scripts found in there are still in the beta stages and are
SUPER BUGGY, so please use at your own discretion. If you encounter any issues, please let me know and I will attempt to fix them.

Most of the code here is code I have written by myself, designed for my setup.
If you choose to use some of this code, you will have to customise it to work with what you have.

The timeline scrubbing mod is not made by me, but was figured out by fellow editor TaranVH. Go check him out.

If you have questions about any of the hotkeys used, I will be slowly adding video's and links in the scripts
that show you how the scripts work. If there is not already a link directly below the hotkey, check the category title.
If there is a link there, then that means that all of the hotkeys in that category work off of the same basic concept.

Thanks for checking out my code :)
